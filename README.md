# Dynamic Chiller Plant Management System

This project implements a dynamic management system using Flask that adapts based on real-time sensor data from chiller plants. It allows users to monitor performance, manage settings, and receive alerts for potential faults.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Displays key metrics for chiller performance and energy consumption.
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: Automatically adjusts chiller parameters based on predicted values for optimal operation.
- **Fault Prediction Alerts**: Sends notifications for detected anomalies or potential faults within the chiller plant.
- **User Dashboard**: An interactive interface for viewing plant performance and making manual adjustments if necessary.

## Flow of the Application

### 1. User Interaction (HTML Dashboard)

The dashboard presents an overview of the chiller plant's performance, showing:
- Current Temperature
- Pressure Levels
- Flow Rates
- Energy Consumption

### 2. Flask Backend Processing

The Flask server processes sensor data and predicts necessary adjustments using the AI model:
- Continuously collects real-time data.
- Uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict optimal settings.
- Adjusts the chiller parameters automatically based on predictions.

### 3. Fault Detection and Alerts

The system monitors critical components for any anomalies:
- If abnormal readings are detected, alerts are generated.
- Maintenance teams are notified to take action before breakdowns occur.

## Sequence of Operations
